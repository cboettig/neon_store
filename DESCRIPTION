Description: The National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON) provides access
  to its numerous data products through its REST API. This package provides a
  high-level user interface for downloading and storing NEON data products.
  While each of NEON's data products consist of hundreds or thousands of individual
  files.  Unlike neonUtilities, this package will avoid repeated downloading,
  provides persistent storage, and improves performance.  This package does not 
  provide expose interactions with the individual low-level NEON API endpoints.
