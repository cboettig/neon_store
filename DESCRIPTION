Description: The National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON) provides access
  to its numerous data products through its REST API, 
  <https://data.neonscience.org/data-api/>. This package provides a
  high-level user interface for downloading and storing NEON data products.
  While each of NEON data products consist of hundreds or thousands of individual
  files.  Unlike 'neonUtilities', this package will avoid repeated downloading,
  provides persistent storage, and improves performance.  'neonstore' can also
  construct a local 'duckdb' database of stacked tables, making it possible
  to work with tables that are far to big to fit into memory.
