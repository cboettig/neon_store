Dear CRAN,

We are pleased to submit neonstore, an interface to the NEON API, 
https://data.neonscience.org/data-api/ to CRAN.  

CRAN maintainers requested: 

> Please always write package names, software names and API (application
programming interface) names in single quotes in title and description.
e.g: --> 'neonUtilities'

Software names are now in quotes.  Unrecognized abbreviations that are 
not software, package names, or API names are now added to the word list,
i.e. NEON, the National Ecological Observatory Network, is a large US federal
project, and REST, is not the name of specific software but refers to a type
of API protocol (REpresentational State Transfer, i.e. a stateless API).
